XML2CSV allows you to convert a very sophisticated XML document to a CSV file. To extract data from complicated XML structure you should just specify aliases in the field's file. Each alias contains the full name of the element or the attribute to be extracted. The full name of the element contains names of all ancestors beginning with the name of the root element.
